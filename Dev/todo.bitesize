ToDo:
    $ 2 Big button for roll and done
    $ Space out the dice.
    $ Screen extension
        $ A ScreenState that defines 5 state - PreEnter, Entering, Active, Exiting, Exited. 
            + This state is used in Game obj to know when to "switch" the screen.
    $ SetupScreen
        $ Create a Setup object to store the current game setup state.
            + This will also provide all the methods needed for the host/client to send message to one another.
        $ Add a Observer button to switch to being an observer.
        $ Player should be allowed to switch to another "role" when they click it.
            + In this case, the active selection will be the role that the player currently is.
            + When a slot is empty , it will be disabled as gray and the word "empty"
Steps:
    $ Finish the local 2 player game first. This will test the game logic and make sure it works.
        $ Finish the game logic.
        $ Finish the input handling code.
            + make it generic so that if the game is a lobby game or peer to peer game, there is no effect.
    $ Allow for hosting and peer to peer playing. (no observer)
    $ Create code for lobby connection
        + This should be create as part of z_framework as zf_lobby
    $ Start a game in lobby mode.
    $ Allow for observer to join in the middle of the game.
        + This means that the lobby code should have some support for this.
