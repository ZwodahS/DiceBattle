     * How to use Game Setup :
     *
     * GameSetup uses the ConnectionManager to manage the connections. It only deals with joining/hosting a game.
     *
     * GameSetup is both a upstream and a downstream.
     * The existence of the Upstream is just in case that this can be extended further in the future.
     * The Downstream provide an interface for ConnectionManager to forward the message to.
     *
     * Both the client and the server needs to have an object on their side.
     * This object will take care of keeping them in sync and will inform the listeners that things has changed.
     *
     * A typical flow for GameSetup will be :
     *
     * 1. A Player decided to host a game. 
     *       In the code, create a GameSetup object to host the game.
     *       The GameSetup constructor take 3 value.
     *          localName : the display name used by this player.
     *          upstream : Usually a ConnectionManager but can be any upstream to send the message to.
     *          header : the message header to identify your message from the siblings node.
     *       Add listeners to this game setup object. (i.e. the lobby screen)
     *       Add this object to the upstream.
     *       You are ready to listen for player joining.
     * 2. A Player connects to the host. (In ConnectionManager).
     * 3. Player request to join game.
     *       In the Code, create a GameSetup object on joiner side. 
     *       Add the listeners to Gamesetup.
     *       Add this object to upstream.
     *       send a join game message to server, using the public method of GameSetup.
