ToDo:
    $ 2 Big button for roll and done
    $ Space out the dice.
Steps:
    $ Finish the local 2 player game first. This will test the game logic and make sure it works.
        $ Finish the game logic.
        $ Finish the input handling code.
            + make it generic so that if the game is a lobby game or peer to peer game, there is no effect.
    $ Allow for hosting and peer to peer playing. (no observer)
    $ Create code for lobby connection
        + This should be create as part of z_framework as zf_lobby
    $ Start a game in lobby mode.
    $ Allow for observer to join in the middle of the game.
        + This means that the lobby code should have some support for this.

Task at hand:
    $ Need a Rule class to store all the ability in the game.
        + the rule object is created locally. It is used for local game.
        + However, in the case of a network game, the rule will be received from the server upon connecting.
        + In the case of a lobby style game, the rule will be saved when the client connects to the server.
    $ Need Input handling for GameScreen
