ToDo:
    $ 2 Big button for roll and done
    $ Space out the dice.
    $ Transit the screen from login to game
    $ MainScreen
        $ A place for entering name
        $ 3 buttons - Local game, Join, Host
    $ SetupScreen
        $ Create a Setup object to store the current game setup state.
            + This will also provide all the methods needed for the host/client to send message to one another.
        $ Add a Observer button to switch to being an observer.
        $ If the game is local 
            $ Clicking on the names allow it to be changed.
        $ If the game is hosted or remote
            $ Clicking on the role will change you to that role.
            $ If the slot has no one, then it will change the color to "disabled"
        $ If the game is hosted, there will be a start game button
        $ If the game is remote, there will be a message "Waiting for host to start"
Steps:
    $ Finish the local 2 player game first. This will test the game logic and make sure it works.
        $ Finish the game logic.
        $ Finish the input handling code.
            + make it generic so that if the game is a lobby game or peer to peer game, there is no effect.
    $ Allow for hosting and peer to peer playing. (no observer)
    $ Create code for lobby connection
        + This should be create as part of z_framework as zf_lobby
    $ Start a game in lobby mode.
    $ Allow for observer to join in the middle of the game.
        + This means that the lobby code should have some support for this.



Framework:
    $ Remember to deconstruct all sockets/listener when manager is destroyed.
